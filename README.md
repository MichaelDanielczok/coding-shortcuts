# Coding shortcuts
Because I always forget the shortcuts, I created this repo. Since PhpStorm and Visual Studio Code use different shortcuts at times, I have difficulty remembering them. That's why this repo came to be.

## PhpStorm
- **Select word (multiple)** `ctrl` + `J`. Press the key combination several times to select the same occurrence of the word again.

## Visual Studio Code
- **Format code** `shift` + `option` + `F`.
- **Duplicate line up/down** `shift`+ `option` + `up` / `down`.
- **Select word (multiple)** `command` + `D`. Press the key combination several times to select the same occurrence of the word again.
- **Open terminal** `shift` + `control` + `´` (backtick)
- **Multi cursor selection** `option`+ `click`
## Terminal
- _comming soon_
